Exercise 3: Use urllib to replicate the previous exercise of (1) retrieving the
document from a URL, (2) displaying up to 3000 characters, and (3) counting the
overall number of characters in the document. Donâ€™t worry about the headers for
this exercise, simply show the first 3000 characters of the document contents.
